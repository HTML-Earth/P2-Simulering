# P2-Simulation
The program is used to simulate the spread of the flu, over a small population (a max of 2000 people).
The program was created as part of a study project, during the second semester of computer science at AAU.
The study belongs to group dat310a.

## Guide to use of the program
When you first open the program you will be presented with a menu, containing severel boxes which represents values used in the simulation.
The boxes are seperated into two sections.
### SIR-Options.
These values represent start values in terms of the amount of people to be simulated.
Susceptible: The start value for the amount of people who have yet to contract the flu and therefore are susceptible.
Infected: The start value for the amount of people who are currently infected with the flu and able to transmit it.

### Spread-modifiers
These values represent which percentage of susceptibles take certain precautions
Vaccinated: The percentage of susceptibles who are vaccinated against the flu and therefore immune to it.
Handsanitizer: The percentage of susceptibles who use handsanitizers, which will decrase their chances of contracting the flu.
Cover mouth while coughing: The percentage of people (susceptibles & infected) who cover their mouth while coughing, reducing the chance they transmit the flu.

## Credits
Pictures shown during the simulation are drawn by the project group (dat310a).
The group consists of seven people including:
- Daniél Garrido
- Esben Jensen
- Jonas Pedersen
- Marcus Rynkeby Jørgensen
- Peter Madsen
- Simon Mathiasen
- Stefan ́ı Dali Mir-Mackiewicz

Other graphical elements such as buttons and textboxes are part of JavaFX.
